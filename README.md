# Predictive Damage Output Modeling - League Of Legends

**Group Members**: Victoria H, Stephanie H, Nicholas S, Jeff K

## Aim

This data science research project aims to predict the total damage a player would inflict in a League of Legends match, given the game mechanics they decide to focus on.

## Files

- Our project methodology and results are summed up in 'report_group99.pdf'.
- Code used to conduct data wrangling, analysis and evaluation can be found in 'project_code.ipynb'.
- Datasets used for the research can be found in the 'datasets' folder; 'description.txt' describes how to interpret them.

Note: I made several modifications to the research project methodology post-submission in accordance to recieved feedback.

## Visualizations

If you'd like higher resolution images than those included in the report, access the 'images_and_visualizations_folder'. This folder contains the following files:
- cm_dt.jpg - confusion matrix for decision tree model
- cm_knn.jpg - confusion matrix for KNN model
- dt.pdf - decision tree model
- figure_1.jpeg - diagram describing how features were ordinalized
